        This method traces back the path to find the end node by utilizing a dictionary `parent`, whose values
        are the parent nodes to the keys. Specifically, the method:
        1. Initiates a list, `path`, with only the end node inside the list. If there was no end node, the if statement would be skipped and the method would return None
        Within a While Loop:
        2. Finds the parent of the end node by accessing `parent` using the end node as a key.
        3. Appending the parent of the end node to the end of `path`
        4. While loop exits if the parent of the end node is the start node
        5. Otherwise, the next parent node is found by accessing `parent` using the most recent node (found at the end of `path`)
        6. Append that parent node to `path`
        7. While loop exits if that parent node is the start node
        8. Repeat 5-8 until start node is added to the end of `path`
        9. Reverse `path` from having the order end-> start to having the order start->end
        
        If end == None, there is no path, and this method will return None. However, if end == None,
        this method will never be called because the `bfs` method only calls __trace_path once the end node was found.
    
        
        This method is only meant to be accessed from within the bfs method
