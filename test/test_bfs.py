def test_bfs_traversal():
    """
    Test 1: 
    Instantiate a simple graph where the order of traversal is clear. Then have the bfs algorithm traverse it starting with 
    a few different start nodes and assert the expected outcome.

    Test 2:
    Same as test 1, except the graph here contains a few cyclical connections. Test that the bfs algorithm handles this properly and does not get tied up in an endless cycle
    Again, I assert the order of traversal is what is expected from a breadth-first search starting with two different starting nodes.


    Test 3:
    tiny_network.adjlist is a connected graph. Therefore, traversing it should return every node. Test that the bfs algorithm returns every node in the network by checking
    the sorted list of traversed nodes is the same as the sorted list of all nodes.

    Test 1:
    0) This test uses tiny_network.adjlist
    Use find_shortest_path to find shortest paths (length 3) that have no other path of the same length between the two nodes, so I can assert BFS will find that path. It is important there are no other
    paths of the same length or else BFS might find those instead; that would be correct, but the assert statement would fail. Here is how find_shortest_path works:
    1) Begin iterating through every node in the graph. Select nodes that only have one outgoing neighbor
    2) Save the starting node, its only neighbor, and one of the second node's neighbors (as long as it is not the starting node) in a list.
        2a) The path between these three nodes must be the shortest path between the start and third node because the start node only had one neighbor. 
        2b) Therefore, there is only one path between the first and second node. Therefore, the only paths between the second and third node besides the direct one must be longer
        2c) As such, this led to the identifcation of the shortest path (whose length is 3) between the start and end node. 
        2d) Additionally, because the starting node only has one neighbor, there is only one possible second node. Therefore, there is no other possible path of the same length between the start and end node
        2e) So this method will identify shortest paths with no alternative path of the same length. In this test, I assert that bfs led to the exact same path between start and end nodes identified with this method
        2f) since these paths are the shortest paths betwen the start and end node, and there are no other paths of the same length BFS might happen to return instead.
    3) Append this path to the length_3_paths list and repeat with other possible third nodes (if the second node had more than one outgoing neighbor that was not the starting node). 
    4) Repeat until all starting nodes have been iterated or until max_tests has been reached, whichever comes first
    5) Then, for each of the unique shortest paths identified, assert BFS finds the same path when using the start and end nodes in those paths.

    Test 2:
    Repeat Test 1 with the larger citation_network.adjlist

    Test 3:
    Instantiate a directed graph I made from a dictionary, and therefore I know what pairs of nodes do not have a path a priori. 
    I then assert run bfs on 5 pairs of nodes who do not have paths between then and test this returns None as expected.
