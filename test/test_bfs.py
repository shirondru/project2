    Test 1:
    0) This test uses tiny_network.adjlist
    1) Begin iterating through every node in the graph. Select nodes that only have one outgoing neighbor
    2) Save the starting node, its only neighbor, and one of the second node's neighbors (as long as it is not the starting node) in a list.
        2a) The path between these three nodes must be the shortest path between the start and third node because the start node only had one neighbor. 
        2b) Therefore, there is only one path between the first and second node. Therefore, the only alternate paths between the second and third node besides the direct one must be longer
        2c) As such, this led to the identifcation of the shortest path (whose length is 3) between the start and end node. 
        2d) Additionally, because the starting node only has one neighbor, there is only one possible seocnd node. Therefore, there is no other possible path of the same length between the start and end node
        2e) So this method will identify shortest paths with no alternative shortest path. In this test, I assert that bfs led to the exact same path between start and end nodes identified with this method
        2f) since these paths are the shortest paths betwen the start and end node, and there are no other paths of the same length BFS might happen to return instead.
    3) Append this path to the length_3_paths list and repeat with other possible third nodes. 
    4) Repeat until all starting nodes have been iterated or until max_tests has been reached, whichever comes first

    Test 2:
    Repeat Test 1 with citation_network.adjlist

    Test 3:
    Instantiate a directed graph I made from a dictionary, and therefore I know what pairs of nodes do not have a path a priori. 
    I then assert run bfs on 5 pairs of nodes who do not have paths and test this returns None as expected.
